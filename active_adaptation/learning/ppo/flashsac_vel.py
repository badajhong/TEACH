"""FlashSAC teacher on VAIC tasks.

The network architecture and the update rule are FlashSAC's and come unmodified from the
vendored upstream code in `flashsac_upstream/`; rewards, observations, simulation, resets
and terminations are VAIC's. The two meet at the action: the actor emits u = tanh(z) in
[-1, 1] and the environment receives, depending on `action_mode`,

    action = ref_joint_pos_ + residual_scale * u     ("residual", VAIC's seam)
    action = action_scale * u                        ("absolute", as upstream FlashSAC)

where `ref_joint_pos_` is already in raw action coordinates. The actor and the critic both
read the same flat observation, which always ends with `ref_joint_pos_`.

    """FlashSAC double critic with optional linear state/action projections before fusion.

    Upstream feeds `cat(state, action)` into one UnitBatchNorm whose scale and bias are
    renormalized to sqrt(d) after every update, so every input dimension draws on one fixed
    budget. With VAIC's 1187-dim state the 23 action inputs lose that competition: measured on
    a converged run, the action's share of the first layer had fallen to 0.15x its value at
    initialization (its BatchNorm scale 0.235 against the state's 0.761). Raising the action's
    share by shrinking the state alone does not survive training, because the two still share
    one budget. Projecting both branches to balanced feature counts removes that dimensional
    imbalance at the original FlashSAC fusion BatchNorm.

    State is normalized before its projection because it contains raw observations with mixed
    scales. Action is already bounded by tanh, so it is projected directly. ReLU after each
    projection turns the widened branches into nonlinear features; there is deliberately no
    branch-output BatchNorm because the original FlashSAC embedder immediately after concatenation
    supplies BN -> unit linear. The original residual trunk remains unchanged.
